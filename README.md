# Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to make Rock paper Scissors Lizard Spock in javascript.
this webpage is for you to be able to play a small game on your free time or on your coffee break during work. something that is small and bite sizes and doesn't take ages to complete.

# User Stories

as a user I want to play a game of chances.

as a user I -

# Features

   * rezisable logo

      the logo scales with the game window size.

   * game area

      the game area will show the game area and will also contain the how to play/ win and lose message.

   * how to play button
      the page will have a button that converts the game area into how to play area.

# Future Features

# Typography and Color Scheme

   For the colour scheme I am going with a white background, light-gray play area and the buttons in the different colour so the buttons will contrast well to the rest of the page so the user will have it easier to spot the buttons even if user has some vision impairment.

# Technology
## html
   Html was used to put structure to the web-page.
## css
   CSS is used to put color and form to the html files
## Javascript 
   JavaScript was used to automate and update the page according to the users input.
## Gitpod
   Gitpod is the IDE that i've used to write the underlying code for the webpage.
   Why I chose this for ease of use and its connectability with github and due to it being used during the Code Institute's walkthrough project.
## AwesomeFont
   Awesome font is a script that allows developer to use special characters on the web-page. there is a wide range of variety and it as simple copy and pasting the link provided on their webpage.

## GoogleFonts
   GooleFonts is a cloud font service where the fonts are stored on Googles cloud service which grants the developer a wider range of fonts to use on the web-page and not having to rely on the user to have the font installed.

# testing

   ## code validation
   
   Code was validated using W3 for html, JigSaw for css and Jshint for javaScript and has been formated to not show any warning or errors.
   
   ## test cases (user story based with screenshots)

## fixed bugs and issues found.

# Deployment
   ## via gitpod
 
   * To use gitpod you have to start a repository on Github. 
   from there if you have the gitpod plugin on your browser a green button stating "Gitpod" is available. that button redirects you to the GitPod IDE
   
   * When it's done loading you will see down in the bottom a few tabs, when you press on terminal you will be able to input a command 
   
   * to deploy your application through a http server you can write "Python3 -m http.server". this will open the http service and GitPod will give you a notification "A service is available on port 8000" with three buttons ( make public, open preview, open browser) so when you open your browser it will open the  index.html files, if that doesn't exist it will open the readme.md file instead.
 
   * This is a good place to test your applications before pushing and deploying on github.

 
   ## via github pages
 
   To deploy a web page in github pages you need to go to your repository on github. there you will see a settings tab. Once you click that you will have a list on the left. scroll down to "pages and click it.
 
   there you will see a drop down menu and there you have to choose your branch of the project you want to deploy then you have to press save.
 
   Once saved you'll receive a notification on the same page with the link to your newly deployed site, although note that github pages can take a few minutes before it's fully deployed.
 
   When you have waited a few minutes you can click on the link provided and now you can test if everything works as intended. if not you have to update your files and push it again. Github pages will update the page for you and again, this might take a few minutes.

# My personal achievements and what I feel I need to work on.

   My biggest achievment was learning how to refactor reusable code and reduces the code.
